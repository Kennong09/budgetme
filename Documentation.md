## AI System Architecture

The AI system in BudgetMe consists of two primary components: the Prophet-based prediction engine and the AI insights service powered by large language models.

### Prophet Prediction Engine

**Location**: `prediction_api/models/prophet_forecaster.py`

The Prophet forecasting engine provides sophisticated time-series analysis and prediction capabilities for financial data.

#### Core Functionality

**Data Preprocessing Pipeline**:
1. **Transaction Aggregation**: Raw transactions are aggregated by date and category
2. **Data Validation**: Ensures minimum data requirements (7+ transactions)
3. **Outlier Detection**: Statistical outlier removal to improve model accuracy
4. **Seasonality Analysis**: Automatic detection of weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns
5. **Trend Decomposition**: Separation of trend, seasonal, and irregular components

**Model Configuration**:
```python
# Prophet model configuration for financial forecasting
prophet_config = {
    'yearly_seasonality': True,    # Capture annual spending patterns
    'weekly_seasonality': True,    # Weekend vs weekday spending
    'daily_seasonality': False,    # Not relevant for aggregated data
    'changepoint_prior_scale': 0.05,  # Conservative trend changes
    'seasonality_prior_scale': 10.0,  # Strong seasonal patterns
    'holidays_prior_scale': 10.0,     # Holiday spending effects
    'mcmc_samples': 0,                # Faster inference
    'uncertainty_samples': 1000       # Prediction intervals
}
```

**Prediction Generation Process**:
1. **Model Training**: Prophet model trained on historical transaction data
2. **Forecast Generation**: Predictions generated for specified timeframe (30-365 days)
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Upper and lower bounds calculated with 80% confidence
4. **Category Forecasting**: Individual predictions for each spending category
5. **Accuracy Metrics**: Model performance evaluated using MAPE, MAE, and RMSE

#### Advanced Features

**Seasonality Modeling**:
- Automatic detection of spending patterns (paydays, holidays, seasonal events)
- Custom seasonality for user-specific patterns
- Integration of external factors (holidays, economic indicators)

**Model Validation**:
- Cross-validation with multiple time splits
- Accuracy metrics calculation and tracking
- Model performance degradation detection
- Automatic retraining triggers

### AI Insights Service

**Location**: `prediction_api/services/ai_insights_service.py`

The AI insights service leverages large language models through the OpenRouter API to provide intelligent financial analysis and recommendations.

#### Core Functionality

**Insight Generation Pipeline**:
1. **Context Building**: Aggregation of user financial data and model results
2. **Parallel Processing**: Five insight types generated concurrently
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for each insight category
4. **Response Processing**: JSON parsing and validation of AI responses
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Local generation when API is unavailable

**Insight Categories**:

1. **Trend Insights**: Analysis of spending trends and patterns
   - Identification of increasing/decreasing spending categories
   - Seasonal pattern recognition
   - Long-term financial trajectory analysis

2. **Category Insights**: Deep dive into category-specific spending
   - Category performance compared to predictions
   - Spending concentration analysis
   - Category-specific recommendations

3. **Risk Insights**: Financial risk assessment and warnings
   - Overspending risk identification
   - Budget violation predictions
   - Cash flow risk analysis

4. **Opportunity Insights**: Savings and optimization opportunities

   - Investment opportunity identification
   - Efficiency improvement suggestions

5. **Goal Insights**: Goal-related analysis and recommendations
   - Goal achievability assessment
   - Timeline adjustment suggestions
   - Strategy optimization recommendations

#### Technical Implementation

**OpenRouter Integration**:
```python
# API configuration for AI insights
openrouter_config = {
    'model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b:free',  # Configurable model selection
    'max_tokens': 500,                # Sufficient for detailed insights
    'temperature': 0.7,               # Balanced creativity and consistency
    'timeout': 30,                    # Request timeout handling
    'retry_attempts': 3               # Automatic retry on failures
}
```

**Parallel Processing Architecture**:
- Asynchronous insight generation for improved performance
- Individual timeout handling for each insight type
- Error isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Caching mechanisms for repeated requests

**Quality Assurance**:
- Response validation and formatting
- Content appropriateness filtering
- Accuracy verification through statistical analysis
- User feedback integration for continuous improvement

### Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategy**:
- **Frontend Caching**: localStorage with expiration timestamps
