# Delete Member Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented delete member functionality with proper modal confirmation and permission-based access control in the Family Members table.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Enhanced Family Service**
**File**: `src/services/database/familyService.ts`

**Updated `removeFamilyMember()` method with:**
- ‚úÖ **Owner Permission Support**: Both owners and admins can remove members
- ‚úÖ **Owner Protection**: Cannot remove the family owner (must transfer ownership first)
- ‚úÖ **Self-Removal Prevention**: Users cannot remove themselves (should use leave family)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear feedback for different restriction scenarios

```typescript
// Key Permission Checks
const isOwner = familyResult.data.created_by === adminUserId;
const isAdmin = adminMemberResult.data.role === 'admin';

// Only owners and admins can remove members
if (!isOwner && !isAdmin) {
  throw new Error('Only family owners and admins can remove members');
}
```

### 2. **Modal-Based Delete Confirmation**
**File**: `src/components/family/tabs/MembersTab.tsx`

**Added Delete Confirmation Modal with:**
- ‚úÖ **Warning Messages**: Clear indication this action cannot be undone
- ‚úÖ **Member Information Display**: Shows member details before removal
- ‚úÖ **Impact Explanation**: Lists what happens when member is removed
- ‚úÖ **Confirmation Checkbox**: Required confirmation before enabling delete button
- ‚úÖ **Proper State Management**: Handles modal open/close and confirmation state

### 3. **Delete Button Integration**
**In Family Members Table Actions Column:**

```typescript
{/* Remove Member Button */}
{canManage && (
  <button 
    onClick={() => openDeleteModal(member)} 
    className="btn btn-outline-danger" 
    title="Remove Member"
  >
    <i className="fas fa-trash"></i>
  </button>
)}
```

**Permission-Based Display:**
- ‚úÖ **Owners**: Can remove all members except themselves
- ‚úÖ **Admins**: Can remove members and viewers (but not the owner)
- ‚úÖ **Members/Viewers**: Cannot see delete button (shows lock icon instead)

### 4. **Enhanced State Management**

**Added Delete-Related State:**
```typescript
interface RoleManagementState {
  // ... existing state
  showDeleteModal: boolean;
  deleteConfirmed: boolean;
}
```

**Modal Controls:**
- `openDeleteModal(member)` - Opens confirmation modal for specific member
- `closeModals()` - Closes all modals and resets state
- `handleDeleteMember()` - Executes the removal and refreshes data

### 5. **Delete Confirmation Modal Features**

#### Visual Design
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Danger Theme**: Red header with warning icon
- üë§ **Member Card**: Shows avatar, name, email, and current role
- üìã **Impact List**: Explains consequences of removal
- ‚úÖ **Confirmation Checkbox**: Must be checked to enable delete

#### User Protection
```typescript
<input 
  className="form-check-input" 
  type="checkbox" 
  checked={roleState.deleteConfirmed}
  onChange={(e) => setRoleState(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    deleteConfirmed: e.target.checked 
  }))}
/>
```

#### Disabled State
```typescript
<button 
  type="button" 
  className="btn btn-danger"
  onClick={handleDeleteMember}
  disabled={!roleState.deleteConfirmed} // Requires confirmation
>
```
