# AUTH COMPONENT TEST INSTRUMENT

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test case instruments for the Auth Component module of the BudgetMe system. The Auth module handles authentication functions including email verification, authentication callbacks, and authentication modal components.

**Directions**: Evaluate the Auth Component module according to the scenarios outlined in this document. Follow each step carefully to ensure precise testing and accurate documentation. If the test case meets the expected outcome, mark it as "P" (Pass). If it does not meet the expected outcome, mark it as "F" (Fail) in the status column.
