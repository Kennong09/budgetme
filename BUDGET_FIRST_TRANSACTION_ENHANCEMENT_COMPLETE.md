- Proper error recovery

## Validation

✅ **Transaction Type Selection**: All types (income, expense, contribution) work properly

Users can now:
- Choose any transaction type in budget-first workflow
- Access all form fields and functionality
- Create goal contributions directly
- Benefit from enhanced validation and error handling
- Experience consistent UX across both workflows
