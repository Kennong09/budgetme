# Family Dashboard Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Family Navigation
- **Problem**: Edit Family button was navigating to `/family/edit/${familyId}` 
- **Route Config**: Actual route is `/family/:id/edit`
- **Fix**: Changed navigation to `/family/${familyId}/edit`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/family/FamilyDashboard.tsx` - Line 1024

### 2. Invite Family Navigation
- **Problem**: Invite Family buttons were navigating to `/family/invite` without family ID
- **Route Config**: Actual route is `/family/:id/invite`
- **Fix**: Changed navigation to `/family/${familyId}/invite`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/family/FamilyDashboard.tsx` - Line 1242
  - `src/components/family/tabs/MembersTab.tsx` - Lines 43, 102

### 3. InviteFamilyMember Component Logic
- **Problem**: Component was fetching user's family instead of using family ID from URL
- **Route Config**: Route provides family ID as parameter: `/family/:id/invite`
- **Fix**: Updated component to extract family ID from URL params and validate membership
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/family/InviteFamilyMember.tsx` - Major refactor
  - `src/services/database/familyService.ts` - Added `checkSpecificFamilyMembership` method

## Functionality Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
1. **EditFamily Component**:
   - Added specific error messages for duplicate names, permission issues
   - Better user feedback for common error scenarios

2. **InviteFamilyMember Component**:
   - Added validation for duplicate invitations
   - Better error messages for user not found, permission issues
   - Prevents users from inviting themselves

### New Service Methods
- Added `checkSpecificFamilyMembership(userId, familyId)` method to verify user permissions for specific families

## Testing Verification

### Database Operations
